# Library: collection of code/tools written by someone that we can use
# Framework: same as a library but with a specific structure and rules to follow
# Route is an end point that will take us to somewhere we want to go ir info we need

# Import Flask
# We can install libraries suing:
# 1- pip (through command line)
# 2- Add it to the properties of this project using settings
# 3- To do it in the code within this file by adding onto our repository a file called requirements.txt
#    and listing all libraries to be installed. Then go onto the py file and click Install Packages

# Within HTML we are using Jinja to input Python code in it allowing us to use the url_for() function within html file

# References re naming/structure of directory: https://thinkinfi.com/flask-adding-html-and-css/
# USED: layout html template + bootstrap navbar and lists + directory standard structure templates/static, Jinja
# Using render_template() instead of slurping the html text. This way we can use CSS and Bootstrap styling
